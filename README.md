Hi there! 👋
I’m a professional QA Automation Specialist with a passion for ensuring the highest quality in software through automated testing. My favorite language is Python, but I’m also proficient in C#, Java, JavaScript and other programming languages used in modern automation frameworks.

Here’s a bit more about me:

🧪 Experience with tools like Selenium, Playwright, Postman, and Cypress, along with CI/CD pipelines to ensure smooth integration and deployment.
🚗 I’m currently working on a portfolio projects: an API for a car rental service and tests for this API.
🔧 I’m also engaged in a relay control system project, working on automating tasks beyond software testing.
📚 Lifelong learner: Currently expanding my knowledge in Python and staying up to date with the latest in QA automation techniques and tools.
